                                The very first time I stepped my foot in the building, I knew I had gotten what I wanted, and then Geemama came in that was it. I immediately called my husband and told him I’ve found a school after several search.
                                I can clearly remember he immediately asked me to wait for him there and the very next day my daughter went to school. <br>
                                BBELC is not just a school; I call it home because I never had any regrets. I was always eager to take my family and friends to the school because of how confident I was. My brother said “this isn’t a school, it’s just like you are taking your children to be pampered” <br>
                                PAMPERED hmmmmm, Geemama pampers the kids more than the parents. They were always eager to go to the nursery because of how they were loved. 
                                I was heartbroken when Geemama told me I’ll have to search for another school for my daughter because I never thought our journey would be so short but everything that has a beginning must have an end. <br>
                                Thank you so much BBELC for sharing your knowledge with our kids and making them academically sound because I know what I brought and I’ve clearly seen the difference.
